# Privacy

**How does the Yotuna app protect my privacy?**

The Yotuna app does not collect any personal data or user information.
It also does not require registration or login.
All data, such as the list of favorite radio stations, selected language settings, and time zone, is stored locally on the user's device.
This allows users to use the app without worrying about their private information.

**What is a device identifier and what is it used for?**

A device identifier is a unique identifier assigned to the user's device.  
It serves three functions:

1. If the user decides to support this project, the identifier can be used during the payment process to assign the donation to a specific device. This allows us to recognize these devices and potentially reward them in some yet undefined way.

2. The identifier is also used to analyze app statistics, such as the number of downloads, the number of active users, and other performance data. This information helps us better understand how users interact with the app and make improvements.

3. In case of errors or issues with the app, we can use this identifier to analyze and fix problems. This allows us to quickly respond to reported issues and improve the app's quality for specific devices.

# Pricing

**How much does it cost to use the Yotuna app?**

The Yotuna app is and always will be free.
There are no ads and there never will be.
There are no hidden costs or subscriptions.
Voluntary donations for the development and maintenance of the app are possible.

**Who sponsors/pays you?**

Our team is not sponsored or paid by anyone, except for you, if you feel like and need to support us.
I would like this app to grow with you and for you. So that we can respond to your needs and fulfill them.
We work on this product in our spare time, also taking care of a proper "work-life balance." Therefore, we would greatly appreciate even symbolic support.

**What are the costs of maintaining the Yotuna app?**

The app itself does not generate any costs for us, but the server part that provides current data does generate such costs.
At the moment, they amount to up to $100 per month.

**How much does it cost to add my internet radio to the Yotuna app?**

It costs nothing, no one has paid us for the presence of their internet radio in the Yotuna app.
We select radio stations that are popular in a given country and have a publicly available radio stream or a playlist of songs.
We approach all requests individually. This process may take a few days, but it can also take months.

**How can I support you?**

You can support our work through voluntary donations, which
will help us further develop and maintain the app and backend services.

# Available Internet Radio Stations

**Why is internet radio x not available in the Yotuna app?**

From our fairly simple analysis of the market for radio stations that share their stream on the Internet, we estimate the number to be around 70k, and we will likely reach 100k without much trouble.
Handling such a large number of playlists and radio stations in the Yotuna app is very time-consuming and requires a lot of resources.
In one word, it is **costly**. Therefore, we decided to independently search for popular internet radio stations worldwide and add the ones we can.
We hope to receive examples of internet radio stations that you listen to and would like to see in the Yotuna app - we have prepared a separate section for this purpose.
We require such internet radio to have a publicly available radio stream or an accessible playlist.

**You have no right to share radio station x in the Yotuna app**

I understand that some radio stations may have objections to sharing their stream in the Yotuna app because they have their own, better app.
In such cases, the Yotuna app still cannot harm you. We always provide information about the website and social media of the given internet radio, so you could say that
your internet radio is promoted by us.
The Yotuna app uses publicly available radio streams that are shared by radio stations on the Internet.

**Why is the quality of radio x poor?**

In the Yotuna app, we use publicly available streams of internet radio stations. Many of them are of good quality, but not all.
Some internet radio stations have so-called premium/VIP access, which allows you to listen to the radio in very high quality for a fee.
We encourage you to support such radio stations by using their apps if possible - supporting creators is very important.
Therefore, we will be very pleased if, thanks to our app, you discover an interesting internet radio and support it.
This is part of our mission.

# Mission of the Yotuna App

**What is the mission of the Yotuna app?**

We created the Yotuna app with internet radio enthusiasts in mind, who want to have access to their favorite radio stations in one place.
Our goal is to provide users with a simple and intuitive tool for discovering and listening to music from around the world.
To start, we added integration with the Deezer service to allow users to enjoy their favorite tracks and artists in the best (lossless) quality.
Now, services such as Tidal, Spotify, and Apple Music are also available.
We will also be very pleased if, thanks to our app, you discover interesting internet radio stations and support them.
