*Last updated: May 04, 2025*

At Yotuna, your privacy comes first. Our app is designed to give you access to music without requiring you to share personal data. Below, we explain what data we collect (or rather, what we don’t collect), how we protect it, and what rights you have.

---

# 1. What data do we collect?

Yotuna focuses on simplicity and privacy. **We do not require login or account creation**, so we do not collect personal data such as name, email address, phone number, or other identifying information.

## Data we do not collect:
- Personal data (e.g., name, email, address).
- Login or user account data.
- Location data.

## Data that may be processed:
- **Technical data**: While using Yotuna, some technical data may be automatically generated by your device or our server, such as device type, operating system version, anonymized IP address, or app error information. This data is used solely to ensure the app functions properly and is not linked to your identity.
- **Analytical data** about your app usage (only if you give consent, which can be withdrawn at any time).
- **Donations**: Yotuna does not offer in-app purchases. If you decide to support the creator through a donation, details are available on our Discord server (link in the app). Any data related to donations (e.g., transaction information) is processed by external payment providers, and Yotuna does not have access to your payment data, such as card numbers or bank details.

---

# 2. How do we use the data?

The technical data collected is used solely for:
- Ensuring the app functions properly (e.g., loading radio stations, integration with Deezer).
- Diagnosing and fixing technical issues, if they occur.
- Improving the app based on general, anonymized statistics (e.g., number of users in a given region).

We do not use data for marketing or advertising purposes, nor do we share it with third parties for profiling or targeting.

---

# 3. Who do we share data with?

**We do not share your personal data with any third parties**, except in cases where:
- It is required by law (e.g., at the request of law enforcement, in accordance with applicable regulations).
- We use external service providers (e.g., analytics, crash logs, hosting servers), but in such cases, the data is anonymized and limited to the minimum necessary for the app to function.

**Deezer integration**: This involves opening the Deezer app or a web browser on a selected track.

# 4. How do we protect your data?

We use standard security measures, such as encrypting data during transmission, to protect any technical information generated by the app. Our servers are secured, and only authorized personnel have access to them.

---

# 5. Your rights

Under data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR in the European Union), you have the right to:
- Access the data we may process (though in Yotuna’s case, this is minimal).
- Request the deletion of technical data related to your device (e.g., anonymized logs).
- File a complaint with your country’s data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated.

Since we do not collect personal data, most of these rights do not apply, but we are ready to answer any privacy-related questions.

# 6. Cookies and tracking technologies

Yotuna **does not use cookies** in the app. If you consent, we may apply analytical tools, but you can disable them at any time.

---

# 7. Changes to the privacy policy

We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes in the app or on our Discord server (link in the app). We encourage you to check this page regularly.
